NFT Launches are supporting the VAF Initiatives

The Astral Giraffes Collections are the first VAF-Backed Collections to launch. These were inspired by a baby giraffe and the realization that there are less than 70,000 giraffes left in the wild. These are endangered species whose land is threatened by expanding animal agriculture. Supporting the Vegan Africa initiatives through Giraffe sales just makes sense. 

The [Astral Giraffes: Genesis Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/astral-giraffes) was the first collection to launch on the Polygon network on OpenSea. 

The [Astral Giraffes: Dragon Collection](https://madnfts.io/nfts/drops/astral-giraffes-launch/?currency=USD) was the second collection to launch, this time on the Harmony network on the Mad NFTs platform. 

Stay tuned for future NFT launches. NFTs purchased support African entrepreneurship, vegan impact initiatives, and giraffe/big game conservation efforts.
